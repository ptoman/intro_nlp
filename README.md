# Introduction to NLP

This repo is for the hands-on component of introducing NLP in an hour-long seminar.

You can read the code by clicking on the ipynb files within github.  However, if you want to partcipate in the hands-on part, you'll need to:

* Clone this repo
* Make sure you have the dependencies (NB: Anaconda makes this simple!) 
  * Python 2
  * Jupyter Notebooks
  * sklearn
  * nltk
  * numpy
  * scipy
* Download the data that is sizeable
  * GloVe 6B at http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
  * WordNet within nltk -- see http://www.nltk.org/data.html for info (in brief: `import nltk; nltk.download()` but of course no semicolons in Python)
