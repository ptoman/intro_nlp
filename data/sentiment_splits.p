p5
aS"by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review ."
p6
aS'the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain .'
p7
aS'more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .'
p8
aS"there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces ."
p9
aS"if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police ."
p10

aS'gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .'
p13
aS'this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .'
p14
aS"it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it ."
p15
aS"this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep ."
p16
aS"although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke ."
p17
aS'star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .'
p18
aS"perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going ."
p19
aS"god is great , the movie's not ."
p20
aS"it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists ."
p21
aS'like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community .'
p22
aS'even if you can\'t pronounce " gyro " correctly , you\'ll appreciate much of vardalos\' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries .'

aS'it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary .'
p25

p26
aS"it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun ."
p27
aS' . . . a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take .'
p28
aS"it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances ."
p29
aS'a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one .'
p30
aS'this is so bad .'
p31
aS'all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure .'

aS' " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . "'
p34
aS'why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?'

p36
aS"i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend !"
p37
aS"terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man ."
p38
aS'its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .'
p39
aS'like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .'
p40
aS"gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it ."
p41
aS'too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .'

aS"satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity ."
p43
aS"my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here ."
p44
aS"the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen ."

aS'a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .'
p47
aS'enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary .'

aS'a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 .'
p49
aS"not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes ."
p50
aS'the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating .'
p51
aS'what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip .'
p52
aS" ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . ."
p53
aS'the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .'
p54
aS'poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .'
p55
aS"you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh ."
p56
aS"it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph ."
p57
aS'murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . .'
p58
aS'you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup .'
p59

p60
aS'the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .'
p61
aS'a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time .'
p62
aS'the film offers an intriguing what-if premise .'
p63
aS' " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark .'
p64
aS'fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .'
p65
aS'only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .'
p66
aS'one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever .'
p67
aS"[jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent ."
p68
aS'well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .'
p69
aS'one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .'
p70
aS'a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .'
p71
aS'while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .'
p72
aS"now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show ."
p73
aS'static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .'

p75
aS"it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on ."
p76
aS'we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .'
p77
aS"it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out ."
p78
aS"the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts ."
p79
aS'a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer .'
p80
aS"hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse ."
p81
aS"maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy ."
p82
aS'better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .'
p83
aS'evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .'
p84
aS"with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast ."
p85
aS'beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .'
p86
aS"at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do ."
p87
aS'light , cute and forgettable .'
p88
aS" . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids ."

p90
aS"a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either ."
p91
aS"there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination ."
p92
aS'carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper .'
p93
aS"beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour ."
p94
aS'see it . debate it . remember it .'
p95
aS"it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas ."
p96
aS"howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a bu\xf1uel retrospective ."
p97
aS"though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature ."
p98
aS"in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good ."
p99
aS' . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal .'
p100
aS'each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .'
p101
aS"it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff ."
p102
aS'the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .'
p103
aS' . . . one resurrection too many .'
p104
aS"it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts ."
p105
aS'affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .'
p106
aS"here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck ."
p107
aS"it's just not very smart ."
p108
aS"opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between ."
p109
aS'has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .'
p110
aS"if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler ."
p111
aS'the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .'
p112
aS'[hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo .'
p113
aS'the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .'
p114
aS'even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . .'
p115
aS'a compelling journey . . . and " his best friend remembers " is up there with the finest of specials .'
p116
aS"like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six ."
p117
aS'a ragbag of cliches .'
p118
aS'though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .'
p119
aS"its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray ."
p120
aS"it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb ."

p126
aS'good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .'
p127

p133
aS'unwieldy contraption .'
p134

p135
aS' . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .'

p142
aS'a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .'
p143
aS'the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .'
p144
aS'whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .'
p145
aS'it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did .'

aS'an ugly , pointless , stupid movie .'
p147
aS'a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events .'

p151
aS'bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .'
p152
aS"not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books ."

p154
aS'the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .'

aS"it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama ."
p156
aS'offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .'
p157
aS"it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children ."
p158
aS"it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem ."
p159
aS"rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical ."
p160
aS'like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .'
p161
aS'the story itself is actually quite vapid .'
p162
aS'if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy .'
p163
aS'shrewd but pointless .'
p164
aS'on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .'
p165
aS'as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .'
p166
aS'an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see .'
p167
aS'while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .'
p168
aS'derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .'
p169
aS'some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .'
p170
aS'the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .'
p171
aS'it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .'
p172
aS"like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart ."
p173
aS"it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match ."
p174
aS"it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds ."
p175
aS'distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .'
p176
aS"holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals ."
p177
aS"movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt ."
p178
aS'this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september .'
p179
aS'the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) .'
p180
aS"while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work ."
p181
aS'it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .'
p182
aS'for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must !'
p183
aS'it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .'

p191
aS'a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .'
p192
aS'the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .'
p193
aS'a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .'
p194

p198
aS'the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .'
p199
aS"judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics ."

p204
aS"the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments ."
p205
aS'the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .'

p207
aS"it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting ."

p212
aS"although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch ."

aS'mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .'
p220
aS'the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .'
p221
aS'the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .'

p10493
aS'dense , exhilarating documentary .'
p10494
aS'more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . .'

p10506
aS'despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances .'
p10507
aS'a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable .'

aS"the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion ."
p10539
aS"baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations ."

p10545
aS'amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . "'
p10546
aS"even if the ring has a familiar ring , it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror ."
p10547

p10557
aS'serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .'
p10558
aS"the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy ."

p10569
aS"a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '"

p10587
aS'the film oozes craft .'
p10588
aS'not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .'

p10615
aS'the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .'
p10616
aS"don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy ."
p10617
aS'the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .'

p10620
aS"too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up ."
p10621
aS'the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished .'
p10622
aS'a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller .'
p10623
aS'if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .'
p10624
aS"the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn ."
p10625
aS'quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?'
p10626
aS"it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep ."
p10627
aS"ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous ."
p10628
aS'if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .'
p10629
aS"you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing ."
p10630
aS'the tenderness of the piece is still intact .'
p10631
aS'its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .'
p10632
aS"the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface ."
p10633
aS"a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad ."
p10634
aS'the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .'
p10635
aS'nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge .'
p10636
aS'the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .'
p10637
aS'a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .'
p10638
aS'this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery .'
p10639
aS'a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart .'
p10640
aS'new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .'
p10641
aS"kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth ."
p10642
aS'an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot'
p10643
aS'what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .'
p10644
aS"director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question ."
p10645
aS'feral and uncomfortable .'
p10646
aS"no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it ."
p10647
aS' . . . hokey art house pretension .'
p10648
aS'one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many .'

aS'from the opening strains of the average white band\'s " pick up the pieces " , you can feel the love .'
p10650
aS'not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .'
p10651
aS"it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death"
p10652
aS'the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .'
p10653
aS"george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind ."
p10654
aS'it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .'
p10655
aS"any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap ."
p10656
aS'a pleasant romantic comedy .'
p10657
aS'a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth .'
p10658

p10659
aS"vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much ."
p10660
aS"it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring ."
p10661
aS"it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth ."
p10662
aS'mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .'
p10663
aS'a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .'
p10664
aS"a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully ."
